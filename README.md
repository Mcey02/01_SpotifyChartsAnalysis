# Spotify Top Charts Analysis

### By: Liam McChesney

#### Description
This project dives into a large spotify dataset of the most popular and viral songs from the past four years. Through k-means clustering this project splits the songs present in the dataset into five different groups. We look at whether or not there are any specific trends involving these groups that would allow artists/producers to tailor their songs or marketing to achieve success.

#### Questions
Specific questions and answers are largely of one kind with several variations. Do any of the following axes show trends that deviate from the whole data set?:
 - Region: Yes
 - Top Artists: No
 - Top Songs: No
 - Chart: Minorly
 - Popularity: No
 - Average Trend: Minorly

#### Application
The found information will allow artists/producers to tailor their songs/media to better achieve success. For example, one cluster of songs was the most frequent cluster specifically in ten Latin American regions. This means that you can attempt to mimic songs in this cluster if you want to do well in these regions. Also, if you happen to have songs already written that are a part of this cluster it may be beneficial to spend extra money advertising in Latin America as it would be most effective and most likely to result in a return on your investment.

#### Dataset
This dataset is the "Spotify Charts (All Audio Data)” pulled from Kaggle with over 26 million rows. This dataset contains the global “Top 200” and “Viral 50” Spotify charts from various countries/regions from January 2017 till March 2024. These charts are updated every two to three days. The dataset is not included in this repository but if you download the dataset in a folder named "SpotifyData" in the same folder as the root directory of this project you will be able to run the two notebooks in succession without any problem. First run "cleaning.ipynb" then run "analysis.ipynb".
